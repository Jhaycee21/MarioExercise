# MarioExercise
Mario a like a game, for exercise purposes




-----------------Bonus Task Added -----------------

*Three or more distinct level with increasing difficulty - 

I want to make this project feels like a game, and i don't think it can be fun with just 1 easy level, that is why i created 3 levels, and i wanna make the player feel excited expecting that there are more levels to play with. I wanna add more content to it and its fun doing it. 


*Customs visuals -

I know that visuals can be basic or just plain images as a variable, but i think it will be hard to pin point on where the character or enemy is facing without a sprites, and like i said i want to make this project feels really like a game and i think sprites and images really add to it.

*Custom Soundtrack

I added the original sound and soundeffect of the mario this game, from the BGM, Jumping, Getting coins, powerup, killing enemy, game over and level complete.  just add more feels to this game.


----------Bonus Task Did not do---------------

*FSM - I am not fully aware about FSM design, but what i did is making sure scripts wont run unless the object with that script is not in the field of view of the camera. also i tried not to put a lot of functions in update.

*The rest of bonus task - I didn't do some of them because of the time that i have, I recieved the exam thursday and i have 4 day to do it. sunday is the last day and the right day to submit it. to be honest i only did the project in whole day of saturday and only testing, rebuilding and submitting on some hours of sunday, since i have church activities in the morning and afternoon till evening. and i cannot do it on thursday and friday because in my current job my boss ask me to do a lot of OverTime. that is why i don't have time to take this exam on weekdays.

Also seems there is a bug in the New input system when it comes to using On-Screen buttons, but i still continue to use it assuming that able to use NewInput System is graded

the equivalent of android controls in pc are (Left and Right Arrow Keys for Movement and Space Bar for Jump)


Thank you for oppurtunities and have fun playing it :D
